**Q1: Why might being required to change our passwords regularly actually pose a threat to our security?**

**A1:** Frequent password changes can lead users to choose simpler or more predictable passwords, which are easier to forget and easier for attackers to guess.

---

**Q2: If I have a six-character password consisting of uppercase (English) letters and (decimal) digits only, how many seconds might it take an adversary to crack, assuming they make one attempt per second?**

**A2:** 2,176,782,336 seconds.

**Q3: Humor us for a moment, and play The Password Game, trying to get through at least Rule 12. While obviously the game itself is in many ways meant to be humorous, it also critiques the experience many of us have setting up new passwords. Explain how there's a trade-off between usability and security in the context of passwords.**

**A3:** It’s a funny way to show how password rules can get so crazy that they make things harder, not safer.

**Q4: Consider the top row of the xkcd comic (936). Why are passwords like those easy (for a computer) to guess but hard (for a human) to remember?**

**A4:** These passwords are based on common substitutions and predictable patterns (like replacing letters with numbers or symbols). While they seem complex, computers can guess them quickly using dictionary and brute-force attacks. For humans, these combinations are hard to remember because they lack meaningful structure.

---

**Q5: Now consider the bottom row of the comic above. Why are passwords like those hard (for a computer) to guess but easy (for a human) to remember?**

**A5:** These passwords consist of several random but common words. This creates a high level of entropy, making them hard for computers to guess. However, the words form a meaningful and memorable phrase for humans, making them easy to recall.

---

**Q6: What is a "credential stuffing" attack?**

**A6:** A credential stuffing attack involves using a list of stolen usernames and passwords from one breached site to attempt logins on other websites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse their credentials.

---

**Q7: Provide a specific example of something that would be considered a type of knowledge factor for authentication purposes.**

**A7:** Personal Identification Number (PIN).

---

**Q8: Provide a specific example of something that would be considered a type of inherence factor for authentication purposes.**

**A8:** Fingerprint scan.

---

**Q9: Why are phishing attacks so difficult to prevent?**

**A9:** Users without advanced digital literacy training often struggle to identify risks in websites or emails that appear legitimate, which may lead them to click on malicious links or inadvertently disclose personal information.

---

**Q10: Suppose that your boss asks you whether the company should require use of password managers for all employees. Explain in a short paragraph why you might want everyone in the company to use a password manager.**

**A10:** Password managers encourage the use of strong, unique passwords for every account without requiring employees to remember them all. This reduces the risks of weak or reused passwords and lowers the impact of credential stuffing attacks. It also simplifies employees’ login experiences, improving both security and usability.
